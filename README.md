# Nova Bank Credit Risk Analytics Dashboard

## üìå Project Overview
This project was created as part of the **Onyx Data x ZoomCharts DataDNA Challenge**.  
As a Credit Risk Analyst at **Nova Bank**, the goal was to identify lending risks, predict defaults, and ensure fairness across loan decisions.

The dashboard helps the bank answer:
- **Who defaults more?**
- **Which loan sizes and income groups are riskier?**
- **How do interest rates and repayment terms affect defaults?**
- **Are lending policies fair across regions and demographics?**
